                    <h2>Hi there! My name is Florent Vogel and welcome to my learning journal.</h2>
                    <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I started to developing some personal projects, i want to become a solopreneur in helping other people to make money with them code. Also i started to build a SaaS, writing booksâ€¦</p>

                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.<br>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>

                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.<br>
                That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
